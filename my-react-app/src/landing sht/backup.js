by the way I almost forgot. In signup I want to 
ask the user allergies he/she can type his/her allergies 
like for example the name of user is "wiggy", gender "male", 
email "wiggy@gmail.com", his password "123", and his allergies 
"fish, eggs, peanuts, milk and so on" . The question how all 
allergy store in database if the user type his/her allergies in 
one line with only comma for separation?. And later on if theirs a 
product contains his/her allergy how to find it in the database? 

what if the user allergy almost 10 how to automatically find it in 
the database his/her allergy and that product contains user allergy?
